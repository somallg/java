# Chapter 01 - Developers' Seven Deadly Sins
* Just as there are seven deadly spiritual sins, there are also seven deadly development sins which can wreck your code:
	* Bugs and Potential Bugs
	* Coding Standards Breach
	* Duplications
	* Lack of Unit Tests
	* Bad Distribution of Complexity
	* Spaghetti Design
	* Not Enough or Too Many Comments
	
# 1. Bugs and Potential Bugs
* Is the most urgent - this sin represents things that are going wrong in your code or that may go wrong tomorrow, e.g an unconditional null pointer deference 
* Potential bugs are a bit more subtle, but no less important

* Instances of this sin are tracked with the **issues** mechanism
* Typically bugs and potential bugs will show up as *Blocker* or *Critical* issues, although that's fully configurable

# 2. Coding Standards Breach
* Like Bugs and Potential Bugs, Coding Standards Breaches are traced through the **issues** mechanism
* More serious example of this type of sin is the failure to follow naming conventions

# 3. Duplications
*
