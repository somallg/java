# SEVEN SIMPLE RULES

* Rule #1: Data First, Structure Later. Mayber
* Structure is expensive and in many cases it is entirely unnecessary to explicitly declare structure to the underlying storage

* Rule #2: Drive the content hierarchy, dont' let it happen

* Rule #3: Workspaces are for clone(), merge() and update()

* Rule #4: Beware of Same Name Siblings

* Rule #5: References considered harmful

* Rule #6: Files are Files

* Rule #7: IDs are evil
