# SCJP 5 - Chapter 4 Operators## Java Operators* The + operator can be used to add 2 numeric primitives, or perform a concatenation if either operand is a String* The &, | and ^ operators can all be used in 2 different ways## Assignment Operators* When assigning a value to a primitive, size matters. Be sure you know when implicitly casting will occur, when explicit casting is necessary, and when truncation might occur* Reference variable isn't an object, it's a way to get to an object* When assigning a value to a reference variable, type matters## Compound Assignment Operators* 4 most commonly used (+=, /=, *=, /=)* The right side will always be evaluated first## Relational Operators* 6 relational operators(<, <=, >, >=, ==, !=)* Always result in a boolean and often used in an if test* When comparing with character, Java will use the Unicode value of the character as the numerical value## “Equality” Operators* 4 types than can be tested:* numbers* characters* boolean primitives* Object reference variables## Equality for Primitives* Compare the value of 2 primitives## Equality for References* ==: check if 2 references refer to the same object## Equality for Enums* Can use == or equal() to determine if 2 variables are referring to the same enum constant## instanceof Comparison* Use for reference variables only* Check if operand on the left side “IS-A” type of the operand on the right side (can either be class or interface)* instanceof will still return true if the object being compared is assignment compatible with the type on the right* An object is said to be of a particular interface type if any of the object's super-classes implement the interface* Legal to test whether the null reference is an instance of a class => always give false## instanceof Compiler Error* You can't use the instanceof operator to test across two different class hierarchies* Arrays are objects## Arithmetic Operators* +, -, *, /## The Remainder (%) Operator* The remainder operator divides the left operand by the right operand, the result is the remainder## String Concatenation Operator* If either operand is a String, the + operator becomes a String concatenation operator. If both operands are numbers, the + operator is the addition operator## Increment and Decrement Operators* ++ increment (prefix and post-fix)* -- decrement (prefix and post-fix)* Can't be used with final variables## Conditional Operator* Conditional operator is a ternary operator ( boolean ? value if true: value if false)## Logical Operators* 6 “logical” operators (&, |, ^, !, && and ||)## Bitwise Operators (Not on the Exams!)* Compare two variables bit by bit## Short-Circuit Logical Operators* && short-circuit AND* ||    short-circuit OR* It doesn't waste time on pointless evaluations* ONLY work with boolean operands## Logical Operators (Non Short-Circuit)* & non-short-circuit AND* |  non-short-circuit OR* NOT efficient. They evaluate both sides of the expression## Logical Operators ^ and !* ^ exclusive-OR (always evaluates both sides)* ^ operator return true if exactly one operand is true* !  boolean invert ~ return the opposite value of the boolean operand
