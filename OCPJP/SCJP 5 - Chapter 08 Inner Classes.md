# SCJP 5 - Chapter 8 Inner Classes## Inner Classes* Inner classes let you define one class within another.They provide a type of scoping for your classes since you can make on class a member of another class.Just as classes have member variables and methods, a class can have member classes* 4 inner classes topics:    * Inner classes    * Method-local inner classes    * Anonymous inner classes    * Static nested classes.* When you design a class where you discover you need behavior that belongs in a separate, specialized class, but also needs to be intimately tied to the class you're designing: event handlers,..## Coding a “Regular” Inner Class* Regular inner class can't have static declarations of any kind* The only way you can access the inner class in through a live instance of the outer class* You must have an instance of the outer class to tie to the inner class* Use inner class:* Instantiating an Inner Class from Within the Outer Class* Creating an Inner Class Object from Outside the Outer Class Instance Code* One-liners : MyOuter.MyInner inner = new MyOuter.new MyInner();## Referencing the Inner out Outer Instance from Within the Inner Class* To reference the inner class instance itself, from within the inner class code, use this* To reference the “outer this” from within the inner class code, use MyOuter.this## Member Modifiers Applied to Inner Classes* The following modifiers can be applied to an inner class:    * final    * abstract    * public    * private    * protected    * static – turns it into a static nested class    * strictfp## Method-Local Inner Classes* Inner classes defined with a method* To use it you have to make an instance of it somewhere within the method but below the inner class definition* A method-local inner class can be instantiated only within the method where the inner class is defined* The inner class object cannot use the local variables of the method the inner class is in. Unless the local variables are marked final## Anonymous Inner Classes* Inner classes declared without any class name at all (hence the word anonymous)* Can define these classes not just within a method, but even with an argument to a method## Plain-Old Anonymous Inner Class, Flavor One* Anonymous inner class – to override one or more methods of the superclass* Create an anonymous subclass of the specified class type## Plain-Old Anonymous Inner Class, Flavor Two* Creates an anonymous implementer of the specified interface type* They can implement only one interface## Argument-Defined Anonymous Inner Classes* Define an anonymous inner class, right inside the argument## Static Nested Classes* Static nested class is simply a class that's a static member of the enclosing class: the nested class is a static member of the outer class, it can be accessed, without having an instance of the outer class
