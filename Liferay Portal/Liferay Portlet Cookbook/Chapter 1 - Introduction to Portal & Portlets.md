# Chapter 1 - Introduction to Portal & Portlets
* This Chapter Covers:
    * Definition of a Portal
    * What are Portlets?
    * Portlet Standards and Specifications
    * Liferay Portal

## 1.1 Definition for a Portal
* Portal is a term, generally synonymous with gateway. A portal is a web application that commonly provides personalization, single sign-on, content aggregation from different sources, and hosts the presentation layer of information systems
* The idea of a portal is to collect information from different sources and create a single point of access to information

### 1.1.1 Formal Definitions
* A web portal or public portal refer to a web site or service that offers a broad  array of resources such as e-mail, forums, search engines, and online shopping malls
* An enterprise portal is a Web-based interface for users of enterprise applications. Enterprise portals also provide access to enterprise information such as corporate databases, applications (including Web applications), and systems
* The key features of a portal are: security, diverse data access, transactions, simple and federated search, content publishing and personalization

### 1.1.2 Types of Portals
* Portals can be classified into many different types based on their applicability and the need they are addressing:
    * **Personal Portals**: the ones used by an individual
    * **Academic Portals**: used by schools and universities
    * **Government and Regional Portals**: owned by government and local bodies
    * **Domain Specific Portals**: like travel, sports, news, shopping, etc
    * **Collaboration Portals**: social networking and collaboration between users
    * **Business-to-Business Portal**: one that connects businesses
    * **Business-to-Customers Portals**: one that connects businesses with customers

## 1.2 What are Portlets?
* Portlets are pluggable user interface software components that are managed and displayed in a web portal
* Portlets produce fragments of markup code that are aggregated into a portal
* Similar to servlets, portlets are web components that are deployed inside of a container and generate dynamic content
* On the technical side, a Portlet is a class that implements the *javax.portlet.Portlet* interface and is packaged and deployed as a WAR file inside of a Portlet container (Portal Server)

### 1.2.1 Servlets and Portlets - Similarities
* Portlets work very similarly to servlets except with additional modifications to account for the change in technology
* Both use **web.xml** deployment descriptor. Portlet have additional deployment descriptor, *portlet.xml*, which must declare all the portlets that will be used by the portlet container
* Instead of HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse, portlet expect either and ActionRequest/RenderRequest and ActionResponse/RenderResponse
* Portlets have a Context interface that allow developers to access the  Portlet application under which the portlet is running. This is similar to a Servlet context interface
* Portlets have their own configuration object, PortletConfig, which can be used to access properties within the portlet.xml
* Portlets use the concept of portlet mode that allows developers to provide varying levels of end-user control for viewing, editing, or accessing help
* Portlets have window states of normal, maximized or minimized that determine how much a portlet can be seen within the portal window
* Listeners and Wrappers used by portlets are still declared within the **web.xml** deployment descriptor
* Sun provides a Portlet tag library that is used for accessing portlet features from markup such as Java Server Pages or Velocity templates
* Portlets can expect to be invoked multiple times by the portlet container to update its area of display. This means that rendering methods must be idempotent. When performing actions on a portlet, portlets should expect that the action will be performed only once and should not be idempotent
* In summary, Portlets are **similar** to Servlets:
    * A specialized container manages Portlets
    * Portlets generate dynamic content
    * The container manages a portlet's life cycle
    * Portlets interact with web client via a request/response paradigm
* Portlets are **different** from Servlets:
    * Portlets only generate markup fragments, not complete document
    * Portlets are not directly URL addressable. You can't send somebody URL of a portlet, only the URL of the page containing a portlet
    * Portlets cannot generate arbitrary content, since the content generated by a portlet is going to be part of portal page

### 1.2.2 Frameworks and Configuration
* Liferay expects developers to define a **liferay-portlet.xml** that declares the name of portlets to be used by Liferay    

## 1.3 Portlet Standards and Specification (JSR-286)
* Portlet standards are intended to enable software developers to create portlets that can be plugged into any portal supporting the standards
* The Java Portlet Specification (JSR-168 & JSR-286) enables interoperability for portlets between different web portals. This specification defines a set of APIs for interaction between the portlet container and the portlet addressing the areas of personalization, presentation and security
* JSR-286 in the Java Portlet specification v2.0 as developed under the JCP and created in alignment with the updated version 2.0 of WSRP

## 1.4 Liferay Portal
* Liferay portal is a free and open source enterprise portal written in Java

### 1.4.0 Why So Special
* Liferay Portal Community Edition
* Liferay Portal Enterprise Edition
