# Chapter 2 - Getting started with the Liferay development platform
* Installing a Liferay bundle and setting up a database
* Setting up the Plugin SKD
* Generating plugin projects
* Writing your first portlet

## 2.1 Installing Liferay and the Plugins SDK

### 2.1.1 Installing the Java SDK
* Download Java SDK and install it
* Setting JAVA_HOME on LUM

### 2.1.2 Installing a Liferay bundle

## 2.2 A crash course in Liferay server administration

### 2.2.1 Removing the sample web site

### 2.2.2 Setting up a database

### 2.2.3 Connecting Liferay to the SQL database

## 2.3 Setting up the Plugins SDK

### 2.3.1 Installing Ant

## 2.4 Developing a portlet plugin

### 2.4.1 Creating a portlet plugin: Hello World
* create.sh <project name> "<portlet title>"
* create.sh hello-world "Hello World"

### 2.4.2 Deploying the Hello World plugin
* ant deploy

## 2.5 Making Hello World into Hello You

### 2.5.1 Anatomy of a portlet project
* A portlet project is made up at least 3 components:
    * Java source
    * Configuration files
    * Client-side files (*.jsp, *.css, *.js, graphics, and so on)
* docroot: the root directory of your application
* WEB-INF: the standard WEB-INF folder for web modules
* WEB-INF/src: source code for the portlet
* build.xml: Ant build script to compile and deploy
* Liferay-specific configuration files:
    * liferay-display.xml: describes for Liferay the category under which the portlet should appear in the Add > More dialog box
    * liferay-portlet.xml: describes optional Liferay-specific enhancements for Java portlets that are installed on a Liferay Portal server
    * liferay-plugin-package.properties: describes the plugin to Liferay's hot deployer: dependency .jars

### 2.5.2 Configuring Hello You
* com.liferay.util.bridges.mvc.MVCPortlet is Liferay's MVCPortlet
* Change <portlet-class> to your defined class
* Change *support* tag in portlet.xml to tell the Portal that your portlet implements Edit mode and View mode
* *init-param* tag, defines initialization parameters that can be used in your portlet. view-jsp defines the location of the JSP file that will be used to display the portlet in View mode

### 2.5.3 Portlet initialization and implementing View mode
* The Portlet API's *RenderRequest* and *RenderResponse* correspond to the *HttpServletRequest* and *HttpServletResponse*, *PortletConfig* corresponds *ServletConfig*, holds data about the portlet and its environment
* *defineObjects* tag define those variables

### 2.5.4 URLs in portals are different
* Portlet URLs are linked with portlet action that cause the portlet to do some processing
* URLs must be generated by the portal server at runtime, so there are no conflicts between URLS generated by different portlets
* The Portlet API provides URL objects

### 2.5.5 Implementing Edit mode
* Declare the tag library
* Make URL available to the JSP by using **useBean** and place it in **addNameURL**
* Use portlet tag called **portlet:namespace**, to avoid name conflict
* The form's action is the action name parameter in **ActionURL**
* Portlet URLs can be one of two types: **RenderURL** or **ActionURL**
* **RenderURL** tells the portlet to render itself again
* **ActionURL** forwards precessing to the **processAction()**

## 2.6 Deploying and testing your portlet
* Run the **deploy** task from the Ant build script
* $ ant deploy

### 2.6.1 Changing the portlet's category and name
* To rename the portlet, editing three XML files:
    * portlet.xml
    * liferay-portlet.xml
    * liferay-display.xml
* These three files are deployment descriptors

### Renaming the portlet
* portlet.xml:
    * portlet-name
    * display-name
    * portlet-info: change title, short-title, keywords
* liferay-portlet.xml:
    * portlet-name

### Creating a custom category

## 2.7 Summary
* The Plugins SDK provides a full development life cycle
