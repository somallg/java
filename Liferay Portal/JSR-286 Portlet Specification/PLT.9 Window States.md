# PLT.9 Window States
* A Window State is an indicator of the amount of portal page space that will be assigned to the content generated by a portlet via the *render* method
* When invoking a portlet, the portlet-container provides the current window state to the portlet
* The portlet may use the window state to decide how much information it should render
* Portlets can programmatically change their window state when processing an action request
* The Portlet Spec defines three window states: *NORMAL*, *MAXIMIZED*, and *MINIMIZED*
* The *WindowState* class defines constants for these window states

## PLT.9.1 NORMAL Window State
* The *NORMAL* window state indicates that a portlet may be sharing the page with other portlets
* It may also indicate that the target device has limited display capabilities
* Therefore, a portlet should restrict the size of its rendered output in this window state

## PLT.9.2 MAXIMIZED Window State
* The *MAXIMIZED* window state is an indication that a portlet may be the only portlet being rendered in the portal page, or that the portlet has more space compared to other portlets in the portal page
* A Portlet may generate richer content when its window state is *MAXIMIZED*

## PLT.9.3 MINIMIZED Window State
* When a Portlet is in *MINIMIZED* window state, the Portlet should only render minimal output or no output at all

## PLT.9.4 Custom Window States
* Portlet vendors may define custom window states
* Portlets can only use window state that are defined by the portal
* Portlets must define the custom window states they intend to use in the deployment descriptor using the *custom-window-state* element
* A deployment time, the custom window states defined in the deployment descriptor should be mapped to custom window states supported by the portal implementation, otherwise Portlet must not invoked in that window state

* PLT.9.5 Defining Window State Support
* Portlets may restrict within their definition, in the deployment descriptor, the custom window states they can handle for each markup type they support in the *render* method
* If the portlet does not list explicitly which window states it supports, the portal/portlet container should assume that the portlet supports all pre-defined window states and all custom window states defined for this portlet application
* As all portlets must at least support the *pre-defined* window states *NORMAL*, *MAXIMIZED*, *MINIMIZED*, these window states do no have to be indicated
* The Portlet should not be invoked in a custom window state that has not been declared as supported for a given markup type
* The Portlet container must ignore all references to custom window states that are not supported by the portal implementations, or that have no mapping to window states supported by the portal
