# 1. Why use Servlets & JSPs

## Objectives
* Servlets & JSP overview
* 1.1 For each of the HTTP methods (such as GET, POST, HEAD, and so on):
	* Describe benefits of the HTTP Method
	* Describe functionality of the HTTP Method
	* List triggers that might cause a Client (usually a Web browser) to use the method
	* Identify the HttpServlet method that corresponds to the HTTP Method

## Bullet Points
* HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, and is the network protocol used on the web. It runs on top of TCP/IP
* HTTP uses request/response model - the client makes an HTTP request, and the web server give back an HTTP response that the browser then figures out how to handle
* If the response from the server is an HTML page, the HTML is added to the HTTP response
* An HTTP request includes the request URL (the resource the client trying to access), the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc..) and (optionally) form parameter data (also called the "query string")
* An HTTP response includes a status code, the content-type (also know as MIME type), and the actual content of the response (HTML, image, etc..)
* A GET request appends form data to the end of the URL
* A POST request includes form data in the body of the request
* A MIME type tells the browser what kind of data the browser is about the receive so that the browser will know how to do with them (render the HTML, display the graphic, play the music, etc..)
* URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. Every resource on the web has its own unique address in this format. It starts with a protocol, followed by the server name, an optional port number, and usually a specific path and resource name. It can also include an optional query string, if the URL is for a GET request
* Web servers are good at serving static HTML pages, but you need dynamically-generated data in the page (e.g the current time), you need some kind of helper app that can work with the server. The non-Java term for these helper apps (most often written in Perl) is CGI (which stands for Common Gateway Interface)
* Putting HTML inside a println() statement is ugly and error-prone, but JSPs solve that problem by letting you put Java into an HTML page rather than putting HTML into Java code
