# The Language of the Web: getting to know HTML
* HTML? HyperText Markup Language
* HTML tell the browser all the content and structure of the page

* To tell the browser about the structure of your page, use pairs of tags around your content
* Element = Opening Tag + Content + Closing Tag

* HTML = structure + content
* CSS = representation

# BULLET POINTS
* HTML and CSS are the languages we use to create web pages

* Web servers store and serve web pages, which are created from HTML and CSS. Browsers retrieve pages and render their content based on the HTML and CSS

* HTML is an abbreviation for HyperText Markup Language and is used to structure your web page

* CSS is an abbreviation for Cascading Style Sheets, and is used to control the presentation of your HTML

* Using HTML, we mark up content with tags to provide structure. We call matching tags, and their enclosed content, elements

* An element is composed of three parts: an opening tag, content, and a closing tag

* Opening tags can have attributes

* Closing tags have a "/" after the left angle brackets, in front of tag name, to distinguish them as closing tags

* Your pages should always have an *html* element along with a *head* element and a *body* element

* Information about web page goes into the *head* element

* What you put in the *body* element is what you see in the browser

* Most whitespace (tabs, returns, spaces) is ignored by the browser, but you can use it to make your HTML more readable

* You can add CSS to an HTML by putting CSS rules inside the *style* element

* You specify the style characteristics of the elements in your HTML using CSS
