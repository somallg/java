# Chapter 13 - Configure Message Level security for a SOAP web service

## 13.1 Select the appropriate Security Profile for your service. The selection would be based on a match of the Protection guarantees offered by the profile and those required by the service
* The first item requires an awareness of the set of security profiles available, and the characteristics of each one - but not enough detail to actually implement a service using any one of them, since not all platforms might support them all

## 13.2 Configure Username/Password callbacks required by the Username Token Profile

# 13.3 Configure any server side Validators as maybe applicable for the profile. There are defaults in GlassFish for most of them

# 13.4 Optimize interaction between client and server by using WS-SecureConversation
